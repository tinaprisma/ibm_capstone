Repository for IBM's Data Science Capstone Project

The idea behind this project stemmed from my interest in exploring various cities of the United States as potential places to live.

I learned that predicting personal preferences is a difficult problem. The more variables we input into the model, the more samples we need in order to make it robust. The number of cities I've visited is limited, therefore there was an inherent weakness to the process. However, I wanted to see how well the classifier would work given these limitations.
